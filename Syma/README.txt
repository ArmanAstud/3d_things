# Summary

Be sure to check out our web site and YouTube channel at http://Video-Drone.DIY3DTech.com for more information on this and other builds!  As here what we did is designed a 3D printable camera mount for the Syma X5 series drone/quadcopter to allow other cameras, or accessories to be added.  There are three versions, the first is a "blank" version you can use in your remixes (please post your results), the second has a mounting loop while the third is designed to to mount to that "mounting loop". 

Want to find out more about this design and the 3D Printing of this part?  Well check our video at https://youtu.be/3xlpj1SMOhA for more information and while your there don't forget to subscribe to the channel to be updated when we release something new! 

What you don't have a Syma X5?  Check out this link (http://amzn.to/2gCCmcX) as if your interested in getting involved drone this is both an easy and affordable to join the hobby!  Oh, did I mention there is a ton of stuff to 3D print for these?  A great combination of the two hobbies! 

# Print Settings

Printer: Just About Any
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .1
Infill: 50%

Notes: 
My suggestion is because of the very thin walled nature of this design is to print at the finest setting and use 1 to 2 walls depending on your machine.  Again you may need to adjust as needed to get a good print.
